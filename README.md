## Automate install and configuration of Seafile through docker on RHEL and friends
#### Tested on Rocky Linux 9.1 with "Server" installation profile


### What it does:
Installing and configuring Seafile through Docker automatically  
Select a drive partition to use for external storage
Automatically configure timezone for Seafile  
Optionally install and start Tailscale to connect it to a tailnet

### What it will do soon:
Not require a separate partition for data  
More!
